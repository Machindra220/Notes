Here's a Python script to organize files and schedule it to run every 5 minutes after system startup. It will:

Move files based on their extensions into specific folders.

Use Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Linux/macOS) to run after system startup.

Steps:
Save the script as file_organizer.py.

Use Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Linux/macOS) to run it after startup.

Scheduling:
Windows (Task Scheduler)
Open Task Scheduler → "Create Basic Task."

Name it "File Organizer."

Trigger → "When the computer starts."

Action → "Start a program" → Browse for python.exe and add the script path as an argument.

Finish.

Linux/macOS (Cron)
Open Terminal and type:

bash
Copy
Edit
crontab -e
Add this line at the end:
